<div class="govspeak"><p>You’re considered to be a pig keeper if you keep a pig or ‘micropig’ as a pet. You have to follow the same regulations as pig farmers.</p>\n\n<p>‘Micropigs’ are pigs bred to be small so they can be more easily kept as pets.</p>\n\n<h2 id="register-as-pig-keeper">Register as pig keeper</h2>\n\n<p>You can’t keep a pet pig at your home until you <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-a-cph-number-from-the-rural-payments-agency">get a county parish holding (<abbr title="County/Parish/Holding number">CPH</abbr>) number</a> from the Rural Payments Agency (<abbr title="Rural Payments Agency">RPA</abbr>).</p>\n\n<p>You must also tell the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening">Animal and Plant Health Agency (<abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr>)</a> that you’re keeping pigs, within 30 days of your first pet pig arriving on your land.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> will give you a herd mark. Herd marks are 1 or 2 letters followed by 4 digits, eg A1234 or XY9876.</p>\n\n<p>You’ll need this to identify your pig or micropig if you move it from your holding (apart from for walks).</p>\n\n<h2 id="get-a-licence-to-walk-a-pet-pig">Get a licence to walk a pet pig</h2>\n\n<p>You need to get a licence from your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening"><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr></a> to walk your pig outside your home or premises.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title="Animal and Plant Health Agency">APHA</abbr> may not approve your walking route if it poses a health risk, for example if it passes close to a:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>livestock market</li>\n  <li>pig farm</li>\n  <li>fast food restaurant</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You must have your licence with you whenever you’re walking your pig, and you’ll need to renew it every year.</p>\n\n<h2 id="moving-pigs-away-from-your-home-or-premises">Moving pigs away from your home or premises</h2>\n\n<p>You must <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pig-keepers-identify-animals-before-moving-them">tag, tattoo or mark your pig with identification details</a> if you plan to move it away from your home or premises (eg for a walk under licence or to a market, pig farm or abattoir).</p>\n\n<p>You must also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pig-keepers-report-and-record-movements-to-or-from-your-holding">report and record any movement of your pig</a>.</p>\n\n<p>You don’t have to report and record the movement if you’re only taking it for a walk under the terms of your licence.</p>\n\n<h2 id="what-you-can-feed-pigs">What you can feed pigs</h2>\n\n<p>You can’t feed pigs catering waste from any domestic or commercial kitchen, including kitchens that only cater for vegetarians. Catering waste includes used cooking oil.</p>\n\n<p>You generally can’t feed pigs material of animal origin or products containing material of animal origin. The following exceptions apply. You can feed pigs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>liquid milk or colostrum produced on the same holding the pigs are kept on</li>\n  <li>former foodstuffs that contain rennet, melted fat, milk or eggs, as long as these materials aren’t the main ingredient</li>\n  <li>milk, milk products and white water (water used to clean dairy equipment) in some cases (find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/feeding-milk-and-milk-products-to-farm-animals-on-your-farm">when you can feed milk and milk products to farmed animals</a>)</li>\n  <li>fishmeal, di-or tri-calcium phosphate, or blood products in some cases (find out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/supplying-and-using-animal-by-products-as-farm-animal-feed">how fishmeal, di-or tri-calcium phosphate, or blood products have to be processed before they can be fed to farmed animals</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can get pig food from a premises that handles material that can’t be fed to pigs, but only if both of the following apply:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the premises has a procedure keep material that can be fed to pigs separate from material that can’t be fed to pigs</li>\n  <li>the procedure has been agreed with a local authority</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Contact the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening">Animal and Plant Health Agency</a> if you’re still unsure whether you can feed something to your pig,</p>\n\n</div>
